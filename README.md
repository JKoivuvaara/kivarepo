# various_projects

Hello! This portfolio was created in a hurry, so it might be quite disorganized/incomplete depending on when you're viewing it.

Most things here are school projects. I've only included things I have mainly made by myself or together with a team. I've tried to be as transparent as possible when it comes to giving credit to other people.

Either way, below you can find direct link to some interesting projects that are not directly in this repository.
